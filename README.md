# UNO

How to play
- Type in the card that corresponds with the "current card"
- The condition to match the cards are either the same color or the same number
- I made it so cap sensitive is not a thing so "yellow 2" is the same as "Yellow 2"
- You draw a card by typing in the card you cant place. So for example: "Current Card: Green 2" I have "blue 3" and nothing else. So I just type in "Blue 3" and it will draw a card.
- There is no endgame screen. I am tired. It ends with it shows that you have no more cards left, or bascially "Your cards are     "
